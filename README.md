# FIP - Couples Resort Project

This repo contains the submission for MMED-1052 and MMED-1054 HW#3 by Jin Cheon.  

The Final Integrated Project for this term involves expanding on the Couple’s Resort website originally created in the web class. For this project, I developed three mobile pages (Activities, Rooms, Spa) and one desktop page (Activities). All pages are built using a static CSS grid layout for both mobile and desktop views.

The HTML was validated using the W3C Validator, including checks for proper structure and outline. Images were sourced from free stock photo websites such as Pixabay and Pexels, and were edited or regenerated to fit the design requirements of the webpages.

Additional project requirements—such as using the ::after pseudo-selector, implementing CSS animations, and maintaining clean, organized code—were also completed.
